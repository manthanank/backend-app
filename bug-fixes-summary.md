# Bug Fixes Summary

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Environment Configuration
- **Issue**: The `.env` file was missing, causing the application to fail on startup
- **Fix**: Created `.env` file with all required environment variables

### 2. Missing Route Import
- **Issue**: The `posts.js` route was not imported in `index.js`
- **Fix**: Added `app.use('/api', require('./routes/posts'));` to index.js

### 3. Missing Controller
- **Issue**: The `postsController.js` file was missing but referenced in routes
- **Fix**: Created `controllers/postsController.js` with full CRUD operations

### 4. Missing Model
- **Issue**: The `Post.js` model was missing but used by the controller
- **Fix**: Created `models/Post.js` with proper Mongoose schema

### 5. Duplicate Module Export
- **Issue**: `errorHandler.js` had duplicate `module.exports` statements
- **Fix**: Removed the duplicate export statement

### 6. Incorrect Middleware Order
- **Issue**: Error handler middleware was placed before routes instead of after
- **Fix**: Moved `app.use(errorHandler)` to after all route definitions

### 7. Hard Database Dependency
- **Issue**: Application would crash if MongoDB connection failed
- **Fix**: Modified `config/db.js` to allow the app to run without database connection

### 8. Security Vulnerability
- **Issue**: `@babel/helpers` had a moderate severity vulnerability
- **Fix**: Ran `npm audit fix` to update the vulnerable dependency

## Current Status
- All tests are passing ✅
- No linting errors ✅
- No security vulnerabilities ✅
- Application can run without MongoDB (with limited functionality)
- Error handling is properly configured

## Recommendations
1. Set up a proper MongoDB instance or use MongoDB Atlas for full functionality
2. Add more comprehensive tests for the new posts functionality
3. Consider adding input validation middleware for all routes
4. Implement authentication for protected routes
